# Interactive neovim scratchpad for lua

Luapad runs your code in context with overwritten print function and displays the captured input as virtual text right there, where it was called - **in real time!**

-------

Luapad adds Lua command (as native lua command extension) with deep function completion.

# WARNING!!!

Luapad evaluates every code that you put in it, so be careful what you type in, specially if it's system calls, file operations etc. Also calling functions like `nvim_open_win` isn't good idea, because every single change in buffer is evaluated (you will get new window with every typed char :D).

Luapad was designed to mess with small nvim lua code chunks. It probably will not work well with big "real" / "production" scripts.

All thoughts or/and error reports are welcome.

### Installation

With vim-plug:

```
    Plug 'rafcamlet/nvim-luapad'
```

With packer.nvim and Neovim >= [v0.8.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.8.0):

```
    use 'rafcamlet/nvim-luapad'
```

In versions of Neovim prior to v0.8.0, the `CursorHold` event is [buggy](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12587). If you're using an older version, it's recomended to use [this fix](https://github.com/antoinemadec/FixCursorHold.nvim):

```
    use { 'rafcamlet/nvim-luapad', requires = "antoinemadec/FixCursorHold.nvim" }
```

### Usage

Luapadd provides three different commands, that will help you with developing neovim plugins in lua:
  - **Luapad** - which open interactive scratch buffer with real time evaluation.
  - **LuaRun** - which run content of current buffer as lua script in new scope. You do not need to write file to disc or have to worry about overwriting functions in global scope.
  - ~~**Lua** - which is extension of native lua command with function completion.~~ *This command will be removed in the next release, because the current version of Neovim has built-in cmd completion.*

From version 0.2 luapad will move towards lua api exposure. Several useful functions are already available.

```lua
require('luapad').init() -- same as Luapad command

-- Creates a new luapad instance and attaches it to the current buffer.
-- Optionally, you can pass a context table to it, the elements of which will be
-- available during the evaluation as "global" variables.
require('luapad').attach({
  context = { return_4 =  function() return 4 end }
})

-- Detaches current luapad instance from buffer, which just means turning it off. :)
require('luapad').detach()

-- Toggles luapad in current buffer.
require('luapad').toggle({
  context = { return_4 =  function() return 4 end }
})

-- You can also create new luapad instance by yourself, which can be helpfull if you
-- want to attach it to a buffer different than the current one.
local buffer_handler = 5
require('luapad.evaluator'):new {
  buf = buffer_handler,
  context = { a = 'asdf' }
}:start()

-- luapad/run offers a run function (same as the LuaRun command) but allows you
-- to specify a context tbl
require 'luapad.run'.run {
  context = {
    print = function(str) print(string.upper(str)) end
  }
}

-- If you turn off evaluation on change (and move) you can trigger it manualy by:
local luapad = require('luapad.evaluator'):new{buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()}
luapad:start()
luapad:eval()

-- You can always access current luapad instance by:
local luapad = require 'luapad.state'.current()
luapad:eval()

-- ...or iterate through all instances
for _, v in ipairs(require('luapad.state').instances) do
  v:eval()
end
```


### Configuration

You can configure luapad via `require('luapad').setup({})` function (or its alias `config`). Configuration via vim globals is disabled. If you want to use old configuration method, please checkout version 0.2.

| ---                     | ---               | ---                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| count_limit             | 200000            | Luapad uses count hook method to prevent infinite loops occurring during code execution. Setting count_limit too high will make Luapad laggy, setting it too low, may cause premature code termination.  |
| error_indicator         | true              | Show virtual text with error message (except syntax or timeout. errors)                                                                                                                                  |
| preview                 | true              | Show floating output window on cursor hold. It's a good idea to set low update time. For example: `let &updatetime = 300` You can jump to it by `^w` `w`.                                                |
| eval_on_change          | true              | Evaluate buffer content when it changes.                                                                                                                                                                 |

| context                 | {}                | The default context tbl in which luapad buffer is evaluated. Its properties will be available in buffer as "global" variables.                                                                           |
| split_orientation       | 'vertical'        | The orientation of the split created by `Luapad` command. Can be `vertical` or `horizontal`.                                                                                                             |
| wipe                    | true              | The Luapad buffer by default is wiped out after closing/loosing a window. If you're used to switching buffers, and you want to keep Luapad instance alive in the background, set it to false. |


Example configuration (note it isn't the default one!)

```lua
require('luapad').setup {
  count_limit = 150000,
  error_indicator = false,
  eval_on_move = true,
  error_highlight = 'WarningMsg',
  split_orientation = 'horizontal',
  on_init = function()
    print 'Hello from Luapad!'
  end,
  context = {
    the_answer = 42,
    shout = function(str) return(string.upper(str) .. '!') end
  }
}
```

### Statusline

Luapad has ready to use lightline function_components.

<details>
<summary>Example lightline configuration:</summary>
<pre>
let g:lightline = {
      \ 'active': {
      \   'left': [
      \     [ 'mode', 'paste' ],
      \     [ 'readonly', 'filename', 'modified' ],
      \     [ 'luapad_msg']
      \   ],
      \ 'right': [
      \   ['luapad_status'],
      \   ['lineinfo'],
      \   ['percent'],
      \ ],
      \ },
      \ 'component_function': {
      \   'luapad_msg': 'luapad#lightline_msg',
      \   'luapad_status': 'luapad#lightline_status',
      \ },
      \ }
</pre>
</details>
<br>


But you can also create your own integration, using lua functions  `require'luapad.statusline'.status()` and `require'luapad.statusline'.msg()`.


<details>
<summary>Example galaxyline configuration:</summary>
<pre>
local function luapad_color()
  if require('luapad.statusline').status() == 'ok' then
    return colors.green
  else
    return colors.red
  end
end
</pre>

<pre>
require('galaxyline').section.right[1] = {
  Luapad = {
    condition = require('luapad.state').current,
    highlight = { luapad_color(), colors.bg },
    provider = function()
      vim.cmd('hi GalaxyLuapad guifg=' .. luapad_color())
      local status = require('luapad.statusline').status()
      return string.upper(tostring(status))
    end
  }
}
</pre>
</details>
<br>

### Profiler

Luapad can profile the contents of the buffers. Add the following line to your buffer as a comment:

```lua
-- PROFILE 

-- or to specify the number of times the buffer should be run: (defaults to 10)
-- PROFILE 1000
```

### Types of errors

Luapad separates errors into 3 categories:

| Error   | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---     | ---                                                                                                          |
| SYNTAX  | Content of buffer is not valid lua script (you will see it a lot during typing)                              |
| TIMEOUT | Interpreter has done more count instructions than luapad_count_limit, so there probably was a infinite loop |
| ERROR   | Execution logical errors                                                                                     |
